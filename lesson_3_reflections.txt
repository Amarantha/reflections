When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are working with others on the same project, or inviting others to add to 
  your code (open source).
  Also, if you want to work on your project on more than one computer, then this would
  be useful.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might want to review the changes before pulling them down to your local 
	version.  You really don't want to have changes happening to your code which
	you're not expecting, as in someone else might be working on the project as
	well and you don't want their changes suddenly happening to your version
	while you're working on it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork: when you want to make a copy of another person's repository on GitHub
	either so you can make changes to keep for yourself which will not affect the
	original authors, or if you just don't have permission to make changes to
	their repository.

	Clone: when you want to make a copy of a repository, either from GitHub to 
	your local machine, or your local machine to another part of your local machine.
